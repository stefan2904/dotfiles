# i3 dotfiles

[https://i3wm.org/](i3) is a tiling window manager.


## Requirements

All configs tested on Debian (Jessie).


You don't need all that, but my configs use it, so if you don't have it you might need to remove the corresponding lines.

* [i3](https://i3wm.org): i3 itself
* [i3status](https://i3wm.org/i3status/): status bar
* [i3lock](https://i3wm.org/i3lock/): lockscreen
* [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/): image viewer (for desktop wallpaper)
* [arandr](https://christian.amsuess.com/tools/arandr/): GUI for xrandr
* [Rofi](https://davedavenport.github.io/rofi/): window switcher and app launcher
* nm-applet: network manager applet
* blueman-applet: bluetooth applet
* parcellite: clipboard manager
* guake: top down terminal
* redshift: adjusts the color temperature of the screen according to surroundings
* xfce4 tools (for example for xfce4-power-manager)
* ... and some more apps I auto-start.
