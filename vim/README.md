# vim dotfiles

[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) is ... well ... you know.

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is also nice.


### Vundle?

[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) is short for *Vim bundle* and is a Vim plugin manager. You need to [install the plugins configured in your `.vimrc`](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim/blob/v0.10.2/doc/vundle.txt#L234-L254) by running `:PluginInstall` in vim.
